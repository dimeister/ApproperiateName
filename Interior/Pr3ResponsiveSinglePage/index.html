				<p>Two years ago they were sworn enemies. But on Monday night, with a handshake, a hug and a sycophantic prediction that “in 2020, Donald Trump will be overwhelmingly reelected as president of the United States,” Ted Cruz made peace with the president – whose help he badly needs in the fight for his Texas Senate seat.</p>
				<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures. Cruz is coming under extreme pressure from his Democratic challenger, Beto O’Rourke, while Trump, troubled by the prospect of a blue wave in November’s midterm elections, is trying to shore up Republican control of Congress.</p>
				<p>So in Houston on Monday, the pair’s toxic relationship of 2016 was forgotten. And Trump – the man who coined the phrase “Lyin’ Ted” – bestowed a new epithet upon his old foe: “Beautiful Ted”.</p>
				<p>“God bless Texas, and God bless President Donald Trump,” Ted Cruz declared at a rally in a Houston basketball arena, as Trump turned to an increasingly fantastical narrative of fear and falsehoods, making unsubstantiated claims that Democrats were “encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation”.</p>
