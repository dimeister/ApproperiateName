		<h3>This collection is comprised of an assortment of things I find truly moving, be that due to sentimental reasons or otherwise. Most of these have to do with what humans can create visually, structurally and audibly, and how they do in the context of place and time. Other features are the interaction of man and nature, and just nature. Three photos I took, which is designed to highlight my love of photography.
