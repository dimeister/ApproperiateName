			<p>1801. &#45; I have just returned from a visit to my landlord&#45;the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with.  This is certainly a beautiful country!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect misanthropist&rsquo;s heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.
			</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff?&rsquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>A nod was the answer.
			</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.  I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you 
			by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts&#45;&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,&rsquo; he interrupted, wincing.  &lsquo;I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder itâ€”walk in!&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>The &lsquo;walk in&rsquo; was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, &lsquo;Go to the Deuce:&rsquo; even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.
